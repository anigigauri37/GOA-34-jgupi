        <h1>Germany</h1>
    </center>

    <h2>In German states leading roles came Berlin (1841), Frankfurt (1856), and Hamburg (1863). In 1907,
         the entrepreneur Carl Hagenbeck founded the Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now a quarter 
         of Hamburg. His zoo was a radical departure from the layout of the zoo that had been established 
         in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages,
          to better approximate animals' natural environments.[26] He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based 
          the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.
