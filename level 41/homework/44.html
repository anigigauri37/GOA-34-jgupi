    <h2>The predecessor of the zoological garden is the menagerie, which has a long history from the ancient
        world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at 
        Hierakonpolis, Egypt in 2009, of a c. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included hippopotami, 
        hartebeest, elephants, baboons and wildcats.[9] King Ashur-bel-kala of the Middle Assyrian Empire
        created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the Chinese
        Empress Tanki had a "house of deer" built, and King Wen of Zhou kept a 1,500-acre (6.1 km2) zoo c
        alled Ling-Yu, or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included King 
        Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, Queen Semiramis and King Ashurbanipal of Assyria, and 
        King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia.[10] By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek
        city states; Alexander the Great is known to have sent animals that he found on his military 
        exeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study 
        or for use in the arena,[10] the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th-century historian
        W. E. H. Lecky wrote of the Roman games, first held in 366 BCE:
        At one time, a bear and a bull, chained together, rolled in fierce combat across the sand ... 
        Four hundred bears were killed in a single day under Caligula ... Under Nero, four hundred tigers 
        fought with bulls and elephants. In a single day, at the dedication of the Colosseum by Titus, five 
        thousand animals perished. Under Trajan ... lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, giraffes,
        bulls, stags, even crocodiles and serpents were employed to give novelty to the spectacle.[11]
        Charlemagne had an elephant named Abul-Abbas that was given to him by the Abbasid caliph.
        King Henry I of England kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock which reportedly 
        included lions, leopards, and camels.[12] The most prominent collection in medieval England was in the 
        Tower of London, created as early as 1204 by King John I. Henry III received a wedding gift in 1235 of 
        three leopards from Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and in 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark,
        renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. It was opened to the public during 
        the reign of Elizabeth I in the 16th century.[13] During the 18th century, the price of admission was 
        three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.[12] The animals were moved 
        to the London Zoo when it opened
        Aztec emperor Moctezuma had in his capital city of Tenochtitlan a "house of animals" with a large 
        collection of birds, mammals and reptiles in a garden tended by more than 600 employees. The garden was 
        described by several Spanish conquerors, including Hernán Cortés in 1520. After the Aztec revolt against 
        the Spanish rule, and during the subsequent battle for the city, Cortés reluctantly ordered the zoo to be 
        destroyed.
