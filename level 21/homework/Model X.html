                    <p><h2>Tesla Model X</h2></p>
                    <p>The Tesla Roadster is an upcoming battery electric four-seater sports car to be built by Tesla, Inc. The company said it will be capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds.[1][2][3] The Roadster is the successor to Tesla's first production car, the 2008 Roadster.

                        Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the Roadster should ship in 2025.[4] Musk said that higher-performance trim levels will be available beyond the base specifications, including a SpaceX package that would "include ~10 small rocket cold air thrusters arranged seamlessly around the car" which would allow for dramatic improvements in "acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering" such as a 1.1 second 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time and maybe allow the car to fly.[5]</p>

                        <p><h2>History</h2></p>
                        <p>In 2011, at the end of the production run of the original Tesla Roadster, Musk suggested that a new version of the Roadster, without the Lotus Elise chassis, would return to production by 2014.[6] The new Roadster was first teased in 2014.[7] At the time, it was also referred to as the Tesla Model R.[8]

                            In 2015, Musk suggested a new Roadster, capable of faster acceleration.[9][10][11] A tweet by Musk in December 2016 reconfirmed a second Roadster was in the works, but still "some years away".[12][13] The second Roadster was designed by Franz von Holzhausen.[14]
                            
                            A prototype of the Roadster was shown in a surprise moment at the end of the Tesla Semi event on November 16, 2017, with an announced availability in the year 2020 at the starting price of US$200,000.[15][16] Musk explained the concept as: "The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars. Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche."[17] Test rides were given at the event for those who immediately paid the first $5,000 of a $50,000 deposit to pre-order the vehicle.[17][18][19][20] Additional information followed after the teaser, such as the various world-record speeds Tesla said it will break.[21][22][23][24]
                            
                            In June 2018, Musk revealed a potential feature called "SpaceX option package" for the Roadster.[25] This would add around ten cold gas thrusters to the car to improve maneuverability; it would comprise an electric pump to recharge an air tank used to provide compressed air flowing through propelling nozzles to generate a cold jet thrust. The air tanks, based on "composite overwrapped pressure vessel" (COPV) also used in the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, would replace the back seats. The thrusters would be used to improve cornering, acceleration, top speed, and braking.[26][27][28] Working pressure would be 10,000 psi (690 bar).[29]
                            
                            Series 4, episode 12 of Jay Leno's Garage broadcast on August 23, 2018, featured Jay Leno inside the Tesla Roadster prototype along with its designer Franz von Holzhausen.[30]
                            
                            During the 2020 second quarter financial results conference call, Musk stated that Tesla plans to tentatively build the Roadster in California and production would be in the next 12 to 18 months.[31]
                            
                            In January 2021, Musk tweeted that production would be delayed until 2022. He commented that in 2021, the company would finish engineering the Roadster with the goal of having a "candidate design drivable late summer".[32] In September 2021, Musk said that production would be delayed until 2023.[33] Musk further confirmed the 2023 target at the 2021 shareholder's meeting in October,[34] which was then changed to 2024 at the May 2023 shareholder's meeting.[35] In February 2024, the production date was changed to 2025 which could fly and go to 0-60 in under 1 second.[36]</p>
