                    <p><h2>Tesla Model S</h2></p>
                    <p>The Tesla Model S is a battery electric executive car with a liftback body style built by Tesla, Inc. since 2012. The Model S features a battery-powered dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout, although earlier versions featured a rear-motor and rear-wheel drive layout.

                        Development of the Model S began prior to 2007, under the codename "WhiteStar". The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008, and a prototype vehicle was unveiled in March 2009. The Model S debuted on June 22, 2012.[8] A revised, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version, known as the 60D, debuted on October 9, 2014. The 60D was followed by the 70D, which made dual-motor and all-wheel drive the standard, followed by the 85D, P85D, and P90D. Along with these updates, Tesla offered the Autopilot driving assistance system. The first major design refresh came in April 2016 when the Model S was updated with a new front hood design. In October of the same year, hardware became standard that supports Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) capability. As part of the update, integrated standard cameras around the car were added. In February 2017 the Tesla Model S P100D debuted, which included a revised motor and was the first electric vehicle to have an EPA estimated range exceeding 300 miles (483 km). The second major design refresh, codenamed "Palladium", was introduced in June 2021, offering a new "Plaid" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension.
                        
                        The Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013[9][10][11][12] and in Denmark in December 2015.[13] Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018.[14][15][16][17] The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3.[18][19][20] Upon its release, the Model S received positive reviews, with praise for its acceleration and range, although initial models received criticism for their high cost and braking issues.</p>

                        <p><h2>History</h2></p>
                        <p>The Model S was developed by a team led by Franz von Holzhausen, who previously worked for Mazda North American Operations.[21] Holzhausen drew upon the design of the CLS series of cars.[22] Codenamed "WhiteStar" prior to its official unveiling, the Model S was designed with an electric powertrain in mind, unlike other electric vehicles where the manufacturer swaps out an internal combustion engine with an electric motor.[23][24][25] As a result, the Model S offers features such as a front trunk ("frunk") in addition to a rear trunk and an enlarged crumple zone.[26]

                            In January 2007, Tesla announced plans to build consumer-level sedans starting in 2009;[27] production was later delayed to 2011.[28] The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008,[29][30] and a prototype vehicle was displayed on March 26, 2009.[31] In May 2010, Tesla announced it would produce the Model S at the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California.[32]
                            The Model S officially launched on June 22, 2012. Production grew from 15–20 cars completed per week in August 2012[citation needed] to about 1,000 cars per week in 2015.[33] Upon its release, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the range for the base model at 208 mi (335 km)[34] while the longer range model was estimated to have a range of 265 miles (426 km).[35][36] Musk claimed that the Model S battery offered twice the energy density of the Nissan Leaf's, with more than double the range, increased by a low drag coefficient, motor efficiency and rolling resistance.[37] The original battery was made up of cells similar to the Panasonic NCR18650B that offered an energy density of 265 Wh/kg.[38] Analysts estimated battery costs to be around 21–22% of the car cost.[39] The 60 kWh battery was guaranteed for eight years or 125,000 miles (200,000 km), while the 85 kWh was guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles.[citation needed] Throughout 2012, Tesla began building a network of 480-volt charging stations, called Tesla Superchargers, to facilitate long-distance travel.[40]</p>
