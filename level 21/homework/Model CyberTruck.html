                    <p><h2>Tesla CyberTruck</h2></p>
                    <p>The Tesla Cybertruck is a battery electric medium duty full-size pickup truck built by Tesla, Inc. since 2023.[7] Introduced as a concept vehicle in November 2019, it has a body design reminiscent of low-polygon modelling, consisting of flat stainless steel sheet panels.

                        Tesla planned to produce the vehicle in 2021, but it was first delivered to customers in late November 2023. As of December 2023, the Cybertruck is available only in North America.[8][9][10] Three models are offered: the tri-motor all-wheel drive (AWD) "Cyberbeast", a dual-motor AWD model, and a rear-wheel drive (RWD) model, with EPA range estimates of 250–340 miles (400–550 km), varying by model.[11]</p>

                        <p><h2>History</h2></p>
                        <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ideas for a pickup truck were first stated publicly in 2012, envisioning a "Tesla supertruck with crazy torque, dynamic air suspension, and corners like it's on rails."[12] In a 2014 interview with CNN, Musk stated that the Tesla pickup would be the equivalent of a Ford F-150.[12] In mid-2016, the outline for a consumer pickup truck was included in part 2 of the Tesla Master Plan.[13][14][15] Musk suggested that the same chassis could be used for a van and a pickup truck.[16] In 2017, Musk teased the Cybertruck at the official reveal for the Tesla Semi and Roadster.[12]

                            In March 2019, following the Tesla Model Y launch, Musk distributed a teaser image of a vehicle described as having a cyberpunk or Blade Runner style, with the form resembling a futuristic armored personnel carrier. It was rumored to be named the Model B.[17][18][19] On November 6, 2019, Tesla filed for a trademark on "Cybrtrk", which was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office but was later abandoned on August 10, 2020.[20]</p>
